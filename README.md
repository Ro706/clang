# c language
This repo is made to store the c file 

``` shell
#include<stdio.h>
```
This a header part of c programming language this is used for printing the data `print statement` and taking input form user `scanf statement` 
``` shell
int main(){

}
```
This is a main function of c programming whatever written inside `main()` function it will execute that.

# short c program for printing hello world
```shell
#include<stdio.h>
void main(){
  printf("hello world");
  }
```
As this `main()` function is of void type it can not return any value.
